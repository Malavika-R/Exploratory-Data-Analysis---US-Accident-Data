# Exploratory-Data-Analysis---US-Accident-Data
A comprehensive US accidents dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 7.7 million records was selected. This dataset covered car accidents across 49 states in the USA, collected from February 2016 to March 2023 through streaming traffic incident APIs.

Valuable insights from the dataset were gained by utilizing the power of **pandas** for data processing, along with **seaborn** and folium for data visualization.

Key areas of study included analyzing the frequency of accidents during different times of the day, identifying the days of the week with the highest accident rates, and determining the months with the highest occurrence of accidents.

Some notable findings from the project include:

- **Time Analysis:**
    - Accidents were most frequent between 7:00 to 10:00 am and 2:00 to 6:00 pm, potentially due to rush hour traffic or people hurrying to work.
    - Accidents were evenly distributed across weekdays, while weekends experienced fewer incidents.
    - The number of accidents during office hours was significantly higher compared to Sundays, verifying the impact of commuting patterns.

- **City Analysis:**
    - Less than 9% of the cities had over 1000 yearly accidents, indicating a relatively low concentration of accidents in most cities.
    - The number of cities decreased exponentially as the accident count increased, suggesting a decay pattern.
    - Accidents were more common on the east and west coasts, likely due to higher population density, while the middle regions had fewer incidents.

The project involved data preparation, cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and drawing meaningful conclusions. Through this project, I honed my skills in data processing using pandas, as well as creating insightful visualizations with seaborn and folium.

Overall, this project showcased my ability to extract actionable insights from large datasets, apply statistical techniques for analysis, and effectively communicate findings through data visualization.
